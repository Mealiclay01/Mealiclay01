# 👋 Hi, I’m @Mealiclay01

I am a dedicated software engineer with a passion for creating robust and efficient solutions. Here's a glimpse into my background:

- 👀 I specialize in software engineering, focusing on web development and cloud technologies.
- 🌱 Currently, I am deepening my knowledge of containerization (Docker and Kubernetes) and exploring serverless architectures.
- 💞️ I am eager to collaborate on impactful projects related to front-end development or backend APIs.
- 📫 You can reach me on Instagram: a.k.m_4k
- 😄 Pronouns: Ciphercraftsman (because code is my craft!)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer bug was actually a literal moth? Grace Hopper, a pioneering computer scientist, found a moth stuck in a relay of the Mark II computer in 1947, which caused a malfunction. She famously taped the moth to her logbook and labeled it the "first actual case of a bug." 🐛🖥️
